The developers that will be funded from the treasury withdrawal after the possible approval of this budget are well known, highly capible, and accountable. The proposal iteslf is something that the Cardano community has desired for quite sometime. It offers node diversity, by creating a much needed alternative to the Haskell node. I also believe this is how a budget should be approved, it should be smaller items, and not a large budget that included a huge amount of unrelated proposals. When you vote 'yes' on this budget, and the treasury withdraw you are not required to fund other proposals that you don't find as valuable. I also hope to see this node require less resources so that it's easier for people to run cardano-node. The resource consumption on the node has been gradually increasing year after year, and it's not slowing down anytime soon."}}
