There are valuable proposals included in this budget that would benefit Cardano, however I believe it's a disservice to the proposers, and the Cardano community by putting these proposals all together in one budget. As mentioned in previous rationale, I believe it's important that we limit treasury spending. It's obvious to me that by including all of these proposals together, there's a direct incentivize to fund proposals that may not be as valuable as other proposals. This incentive comes from the fact that there is valuable proposals in the budget, and the community wants to see them funded. I believe this is the worst option for a budget approval. I believe submitting different governance actions for each type of proposal is better than submitting one budget. This would give dReps the ability to approve a budget for market, or a different budget for development."}}
